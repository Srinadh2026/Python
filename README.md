# 📊 Urban vs Rural Literacy Rate Analysis in India

This project analyzes and compares **literacy and graduation statistics** between rural and urban populations across Indian states. Using government census data, we explore gender disparities, urban-rural gaps, and perform clustering to identify patterns in educational access.

---

## 📁 Datasets Used

- `states_rural.csv`: Literacy and graduation data for rural regions by state.
- `states_urban.csv`: Literacy and graduation data for urban regions by state.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Compare literacy levels between rural and urban areas.
- Identify gender-based disparities in graduation percentages.
- Analyze state-wise differences in education levels.
- Perform clustering to group states with similar education patterns.
- Visualize insights using charts and graphs.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – clustering (KMeans)
- **Jupyter Notebook** or any Python IDE

---

## 📌 Key Features

- 📉 **Bar Charts**: Compare literate males/females by region and state.
- 📈 **Graduation Gender Gap**: Male vs female graduate percentage by region.
- 📊 **Urban-Rural Literacy Gap**: Visualized for all states.
- 🤖 **KMeans Clustering**: Group states by education metrics.
- 🔍 **Equity Analysis**: Identify states with most/least education disparity.

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

- **Literate Males and Females: Rural vs Urban**
- **Graduate Percentage Comparison**
- **Gender Graduation Gap**
- **Urban-Rural Literacy Rate Gap**
- **Clustering of States Based on Literacy Stats**

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/urban-vs-rural-literacy.git
   cd urban-vs-rural-literacy
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
3. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   # OR
   jupyter notebook literacy_analysis.ipynb

--- 

## 📈 Clustering Output (KMeans)
- **Using features like:**
- Literate males
- Literate females
- % Graduate males
- % Graduate females
- We grouped states into clusters for better understanding of education profiles across regions.

---

## 📌 Project Conclusion
- Urban regions consistently show better literacy and graduation rates.
- Gender disparities persist more in rural areas.
- States like Kerala and Delhi perform better on education equity.
- Clustering helped identify patterns in state-wise education development.
